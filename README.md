## Limitations

While the YouTube Genie is a powerful tool, it does come with a few limitations:

 **Token Limit:** The underlying OpenAI model has a maximum token limit of 8192. This means that your queries, including both input and output, must fit within this constraint.

### Overcoming Token Limit:

Here are some tips to work within the token limit:

- **Trim Queries:** If you encounter a "token limit" error, consider shortening your queries. Reducing the length of your input text or breaking down complex queries into smaller parts can help.

- **Summary Approach:** Rather than asking lengthy questions in a single query, opt for a summary approach. Ask concise questions to gather the most critical information.

- **Interaction in Iterations:** If you need extensive information, break your interaction into iterations. Ask a series of questions, process the responses, and continue the conversation.

- **Prioritize Queries:** Focus on the most crucial queries to stay within the token limit. Avoid overly verbose or repetitive questions.

Remember, the genie is here to assist, and with strategic queries, you can make the most of its magical insights!
